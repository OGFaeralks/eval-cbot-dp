1,"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. Possibility of post infectious bronchitis is more likely. Bronchitis (inflammation of airways) is common after pneumonia.And persistent dry cough and chest pain are mostly due to bronchitis.So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test).PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. You will mostly improve with inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or salmeterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone).Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.","Respected user , hi Thanks for using Healthcaremagic.comI have evaluated your query thoroughly .* All symptoms are in relation with underlying lung condition giving rise to   broncho alveolar constrictions , pleura irritation with systemic    manifestations* As there is not much relief of oral medications given till now , I strongly   recommend to get hospitalised treatment & early better recovery through   IV antibiotics , bronchodilators, supportive nursing care Hope this clears your queryWelcome for any further assistance Regards .",0.6595744680851063

Using symptoms of fever, cough, or runny nose to screen for COVID-19 is not accurate because colds and flu have such symptoms. COVID testing is by nasal swab, but there's a shortage of test kits in this pandemic. Only local resources know local testing sites, times, restrictions. Even a negative test does not guarantee one does not have COVID-19. Safest for people to stay away from ICU patients.",0.6

3,"Thanks for your concern. The dry cough basically has a few causes....First is Post nasal drip, second  Gastroesophageal reflux'heart burn', third Cough variant aasthma, forth Heart failure and finally Interstitial lung disease. Based on the information if you don't have a heart burn or reflux of food or sour brash into your mouth, you are having a cough variant asthma, make sure you do not have difficulty breathing. There is something called cardiac asthma, but it's not much of a likelihood given your young age.I advice you that you give up on smoking as it causes a multitude of problems and may well be related to the cough you've been having now called as 'smokers cough'.It's time that you stop smoking, avoid animal dancers, mites, pollens and any thing that would exacerbate the illness, make sure you don't have a heart burn, and if still the cough persists , meet a pulmo neologism and get a Pulmonary function test with methacholine challenge.","No not now   GEt telephonic consult via this or other forums.   Not indicated to be tested right now. Use medication you have at home to treat symptoms right now. Use this forum if symptoms change.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?",0.65
