"I have a dry cough and sore throat- it's been a week now and the cough seems to be getting worse- no runny nose or fever, sometimes a headache, no shortness of breath...should I get tested for covid19?","Hard to guess. You have some of the  symptoms of cold , flu and covid19 . Also you appear to be dehydrated. But you are young and no mention of any underlying medical condition.

"If you've been infected by SARS-CoV-2, develop Covid-19 symptoms and recover, can you: 1) develop immunity to Covid-19 2) infect others after 14 days post-symptom onset & recovery 3) get re-infected later by SARS-CoV-2 despite developing immunity?","After symptoms show.

I was on a plane on March 8th have been home ever since self quarantine myself I have had headaches and runny throat I have 2 days left of my self quarantine should I be having worse symptoms by now ?,"Thanks for your concern. The dry cough basically has a few causes....First is Post nasal drip, second  Gastroesophageal reflux'heart burn', third Cough variant aasthma, forth Heart failure and finally Interstitial lung disease. Based on the information if you don't have a heart burn or reflux of food or sour brash into your mouth, you are having a cough variant asthma, make sure you do not have difficulty breathing. There is something called cardiac asthma, but it's not much of a likelihood given your young age.I advice you that you give up on smoking as it causes a multitude of problems and may well be related to the cough you've been having now called as 'smokers cough'.It's time that you stop smoking, avoid animal dancers, mites, pollens and any thing that would exacerbate the illness, make sure you don't have a heart burn, and if still the cough persists , meet a pulmo neologism and get a Pulmonary function test with methacholine challenge.",COVID   These are HealthTap guidelines:https://www.  healthtap.com/blog/covid-19-care-guidelines/virtual-care-guidelines-for-covid-19?utm_campaign=COVID%20OUTREACH&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=84951814&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_jlHAfqZrXrCncGR4mJ57eQcomM2TItlnybAQii_sH-f4IyZjpz7-eIVc1oKN2_qDpZnO3&utm_content=84951814&utm_source=hs_emailI agree your symptoms should be improving.
