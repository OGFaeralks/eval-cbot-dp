    - Hello doctor, I get a cough for the last few days, which is heavy during night times. No raise in temperature but feeling tired with no travel history. No contact with any Covid-19 persons. It has been four to five days and has drunk a lot of Benadryl and took Paracetamol too. Doctors have shut the OP so do not know what to do? Please help.
    - Thank you doctor, I have phlegm but not a lot. A tiny amount comes out most of the time. I have no difficulty in breathing. No medical conditions and not a smoker nor a drinker.
    - Hello doctor, I am suffering from coughing, throat infection from last week. At that time fever did not persist and also did not felt any chest pain. Two days later, I consulted with a doctor. He prescribed Cavidur 625, Montek LC, Ambrolite syrup and Betaline gargle solution. Since then throat infection improved and frequent cough also coming out. Coughing also improved remarkably though not completely. From yesterday onwards fever is occuring (maximum 100-degree Celcius). I have not come in touch with any foreign returned person nor went outside. In our state, there is no incidence of Covid-19. Please suggest what to do?
    - Thank you doctor, After doing all these I can upload all for further query.
    - Thank you doctor, As per your guidelines, I have made one test. Due to city shutdown, I could not able to make an x-ray of chest. Fever is coming every 12 hours. But cough does not persist currently. The only problem is a fever. I am uploading the blood examination report. Please advice.
    - Thank you doctor, How many tablets of Azithromycin to be taken? Is it in the morning? I want to make you know that I have already taken Azithromycin five days before. Should she start it? And also can I start an Iron tablet today itself?
    - Hello doctor,Last night I was getting chills, feeling more cold than usual and lightheaded and a lot of burping. Maybe like every 30 minutes or less or so feel more chills running down my body and chest feeling bit weird like I am starting having [trouble breathing](symptom) then goes back to normal and repeats, with weird feeling like chills down my left and right lungs or left and right upper chest. Also, my heart was pumping fast. Also, some [minor coughs](symptom) were there since seven days ago, still here. I have [white mucus](symptom) and have not gotten yellow yet.I took medicines yesterday but today I got severe cold and flu medicine with a pain reliever, the chills did not go away. Then today, I called the doctor on the phone and told him what happen last night and the same thing happened this morning too. I had [minor coughs](symptom), feeling lightheaded, feel like maybe cannot breathe or something, and a lot of burping. I told him the burping issue was going on for at least two years, but somehow this time I am feeling lightheaded. He just gives Pepcid, a try maybe GERD. I ate that today still feeling chills now and still burping a lot.Right now, still some chills on arms, with breathing issue or something makes my chest feel weird and arm sometimes. So, should I be worried? I do not think I have a [fever](symptom) now but do not feel hot on the forehead? Was it GERD or flu, it is Coronavirus or something else? I hope it is not Coronavirus.I am 21 years old and weigh around 110-115 kg.
    - Thank you doctor, I travel to school, nearby grocery stores in the bus. No airport exposure. I have not checked the temperature. I do not feel hot or anything. I have minor coughs and sore throat. Yes, I have mucus which seems white or clear for now.During sleep, I do not have much [aches](symptom). Last night I have not got much sleep, probably because I was thinking about stuff being worried, but got some sleep though.
    - Thank you doctor, I woke up this morning, I had trouble sleeping being worried, but I got some sleep then nearby phone ringing woke me up.So far, seems no one got any severe coughs or pain so far. I only hear minor coughs the past week or so. Thanks for those medicine recommendations for sleep. I fall asleep quicker, usually, it takes me around one hour to fall asleep on most days.I will try to avoid smoking as much as possible. Yes, I will be staying inside since many places are on lockdown. And school is online. I recently turned on the air purifier to clean up some air for allergies possible viruses but makes me cold. I might not need AC unless really hot.I will be staying home for the next month at least. My chills right now are feeling a bit better, but a little sick only because maybe I did not get enough sleep.I stay in San Francisco CA, United States, and there are close to 40 confirmed cases around here. No severe reports near my district, and have not heard anyone in serious condition.So, last week I have a sore throat and tonsil pain while swallowing for a few days, then one day drank a lot of honey and water and some tea, then it got better. Not sure if it got smaller, but the pain was less now though. Between my tonsils in the middle (behind the tongue) looks like my throat, got some red stuff, maybe looks like inflamed or rashes. Any recommendations? Any foods or drinks that can help?
    - Thank you doctor, As of now 12:40 PM I am breathing harder than usual since 30 minutes ago. I only ate some breakfast and drank water.Here is my story Before Feb 28th - no issues at all, besides always burping a lot, sometimes bloating, no coughs, tonsil was enlarged for a while, no lightheadedness, no breathing problems, not sick.Friday February 28th - I woke up feeling unwell, drank water went back to bed, came back out super lightheaded about to faint, lied on bed for an hour, came out stomach feeling weird, even more lightheaded about to faint, can barely even eat a little noodles and two small pieces of spam, vomited it, then four more times which as water or acid. Hours later was better.Saturday February 29th - diarrheaSunday March 1st - diarrheaMonday March 2 - diarrheaTuesday March 3 - diarrheaWednesday March 4 - No stoolThursday March 3 - No more diarrheaFriday March 4th - Monday March 9th - no issuesMonday March 9th - feeling better, no problems, enlarged tonsil, no coughs really.Sunday march 15 - no problems besides burping, minor coughs, some sore throatAfternoon I ate chicken, burping a lot, stomach uncomfortable, felt like breathing problems, chills on hands, chest and left and right side, felt like could not breathe. 20 minutes later, still chills breathing a bit better, lightheaded kind of feel like fainting, then went to bed for 15 minutes (the breathing problem and weird chest feeling comes back randomly), ate tums, then later I drank cough and flu medicine.On Monday march 16 - woke up around 11:30 AM, feeling breathing problems, chills around body, lightheaded again, chest feeling weird, burping a lot, and I described my story to doctor he said it sounds like you ate something bad, does sound like GERD, of course we do not know for sure unless lab tests maybe on stool. He asked have you tried stronger antacids like Pepcid or Zantac?I said no. Then doctor asked me to try Pepcid and tell me how it goes.Tuesday and Wednesday March 16/17 - feeling better, no lightheadedness, no more chills, minor coughs, sore throat, burping a lot, no breathing problems so far. Pepcid no problems so far besides making me burp almost all day.Wednesday night still coughing a lot and drank severe cold and flu medicine.Thursday march 21 I woke up fine, then once ate Pepcid and drank some water, heart rate was going really fast, started to make worried, called doctor office they said can you count your beats per minute, then I counted, my phone was showing my heart rating going to 120 bpm, when I counted to them was not 120 bpm, then they told me to call back if it gets worse. Then shortly after, I drank some water and ate a little bit of breakfast. My heart rate started to drop slowly and was getting better after that.Friday march 20- 10 AM I woke up with some chest pains (chest area above the stomach), then some coughing and feeling a little sick, little lightheaded, heart beating fast, breathing harder, felt of shortness of breath. Drank some water and breathe harder, a little bit of mucus.15-20 minutes later no more chest pains, still breathing harder.11 AM - still breathing a little bit harder than usual, coughing would make me breathe even harder. Better now, but still breathing a little harder than usual.11:30 AM moving makes me breathe harder, sat in bed.11:58 AM - feeling a bit better12:10 - feeling like breathing a harder than usual.After an hour later, feeling better now which is strange. Not sure if its heart problems, acid reflux, chest issues, or esophagus.
    - Thank you doctor, I was trying to finish the bowl of food in one hour. I was eating veggies and rice, halfway through felt something like acid may be some pain in chest and throat. Feeling lightheaded so ate some meat to then coughed after.
    - Thank you doctor,I really appreciate your help so much. I appreciate your time and effort to help me and give advice. Only thing I am worried is just the chest pains, breathing issues and esophagus and throat stuff. I will try to wait two to three hours after eating or drinking before bed now. I hope to get less chest issues when I wake up.
    - Yeah if it doesn't get better Laryngoscopy would be perfect. Okay, I'll give it some time Thank you!I try to eat vegetables and fruits. I don't eat much junk food that much. I used to eat more junk years ago, but now mostly vegetables, fruits, meat (pork, chicken, beef, fish) usually not fried, and tried to eat whole wheat bread with fried chicken patty from the super market (for school lunch) since its cheap and its chicken (stopped now after acid problems), don't really eat french fries, pizza or drink soda etc...Exercise, haven't been exercising these few months. I have been telling myself that, but then i haven't really been doing it. Used to a lot years ago, now barely.Since high school, when i exercise running when i try to get air feels like throat is tight or chest is tight and air is trying to squeeze its way through. After this point High school until college feels like i'm not breathing enough air. When i was younger (Elementary/middle school) felt like i gotten a lot more air then now through my throat and air doesn't squeezes through.One doctor just used stethoscope for heart and lungs, told me to breathe hasn't said much about it. Then another doctor said, sounds you are not breathing that much, feels like not getting another air (in high school, like 4-6 years ago maybe), they didn't do much about it.So, when i try to breath regularly, seems like not much air comes out through mouth even before acid reflux,.That's why recent breathing problems kinda worry me, but anyways yeah like that.

    - Hi, I m a 55 yr old white female, 5`4 , 180 lbs. I had childhood asthma and bronchitis, and were given steroids frequently. I seemed to grow out of it at age 17. During the last 14 yrs I ve developed Fibromyalgia/Chronic Fatigue, RA, for 14 months my SED rate stayed at 53-108 and they could not find out why, Cushing s Syndrome, neuropathy of the feet, and most importantly - Hypogammagobulinemia. I rec d IGG iv s monthly for 4 yrs, then lost insurance 6 yrs. ago. I m disabled and on Medicare, I haven t rec d IV s in 6 yrs. During that time I ve had [pneumonia](symptom) 17 times, once was septic [pneumonia](symptom), constant sinus problems, PCP infection and a rare form of arthritis associated with the hypo (the Dr. couldn t tell me the name of it). I have contacted Medicare, foundations and pharm companies trying to get help to start treatment again. Reaching out to any possible help has been met with apathy and no one would try to point me in the right direction. I m really worried and would like to know my chances of surviving if I can t get the IGG treatments. Thank you very much for your time.
    - I was given amoxycillin for a chest infection and did not improve after 48 hours, therefore I went back to the GP who then gave me Clarythmomycin as it resulted in [pneumonia](symptom). I have been off work for 3 weeks now and feel completely washed out and exhausted. I had a chest x-ray which was clear, but was given an inhaler temporarily as I was out of breath and wheezy. I still have an incredible amount of phlegm which has now changed from brown to sometimes green to clear. Unfortunately, for last 3 days, my trachea is extremely bruised to touch and feel as if someone is pressing my windpipe. Although my tonsils aren t swollen, my ear hurts deep inside. I have had to start taking paracetamol again this week as feel weak, wobbly and feel as if I am going backwards again instead of improving. I am 45 years old. Non-smoker.This is the 3rd time I have had [pneumonia](symptom) in 18 years. I am reasonably fit and healthy, and I don t suffer from colds normally, but whenever I come down with something, I seem to suffer with it. How long does it take to get back to normal? Are the trachea symptoms part of the initial [pneumonia](symptom) symptoms or would I need to see the GP again. I am feeling extremely fed up of generally feeling unwell. I am taking a tonic (Metatone) and drinking and eating healthily. Basically, is it normal to feel this unwell for so long.
    - My sister, age 72, and living alone drove herself to an emergency room at 4:00 a.m. with temperature of 101+, chills and a little dizziness. They diagnosed her with pneumonia. She has [COPD](symptom) and uses inhalers and oral meds. I am concerned because she just told me she is extremely tired and has been under a lot of stress due to move from home of 45+ years, family concerns and loss of husband 2 years ago. She had [hip replacement](symptom) three months ago. I live an hour and a half away and am wondering if I should drive to her city and check on her. She does have a son and a neighbor friend looking in on her.
    - I have my son that has caught [fever](symptom) and [fatigue](symptom).
    - I have been on methadone for approx. 5 years now at a dose of 30mg taken 4 times daily. This has not only stopped any unpleasant withdrawl symptoms but has also offered considerable relief in easing chronic pain from a severe back injury 11 years ago. For the first 3 years of taking the medication I found that while it was effective in these areas their was an exceptional side effect in that it absolutely obliterated any interest in [sex](symptom) or even the ability to physically have [sex](symptom). Also I found that I had next to no energy, making many things I used to enjoy fall by the wayside which in turn led to severe depression. After extensive talks with my Doctor I was sent for blood analysis and it was found that my level of testosterone was so low it barely registered. I was then put on a 3 week cycle of injections of 2mls of Delatestryl and for the past several years I have been the person that I used to be (it gave me my life back). Know I have been given a new Doctor at the clinic I attend and he has informed me that he is only there to prescribe methadone and will not be responsible for any other prescriptions. I do not have a family doctor and our emerg has said that this falls outside their domain. The walk in clinic treats every individual that I know so badly that their is no doubt in my mind that they will refuse to continue this presciption. (to give you some perspective on our walk in clinic - I went their several mnths back with sever pneumonia and the Doctor looked at my chart once and told me that I would get know %$# narcotics from him and to leave immediately) Any suggestions on how to get across to my knew methadone Doctor (who has only been in prescribing methadone for 2 months) just how much this would severely negatively impact my life?
    - My daughter is 11 years old she has has [pneumonia](symptom) she has been sick since January 3rd symptoms keep changing. she is up at night itching all over her upper torso, head, and ears. She has major headache and abdominal pain.. she is very upset and crying because this is going on way to long and she has seen many doctors with no relief any suggestions. Tried most itching products what could be causing the head pain and stomach pain. they check her today for appendicitis.

    - I am positive for Alpha 1 but at this point am not being treated. I developed bilateral pneumonia 4 weeks ago, have been on two rounds of Levaquin, and other than my fever leaving (which was 102 for three days) don t feel any better. My ribs feel like someone punched me, and whenever I cough, I taste copper which I am assuming is blood. It s probably from how hard I cough,. Been to the doc twice, this time added mucinex to the mix to try to loosen things up. Not sure how much longer I can do this! YYYY@YYYY.
    - My mother was admitted to St. Jude s last Wednesday with pneumonia. She is 82 and also has COPD and Parkinson s. She was treated with antibiotics and released four days later. She is to continue with antibiotics treatment at her skilled nursing facility for another 7 days. The day after she returned to her skilled nursing facility, she was given a new roommate who has advanced pneumonia and in critical condition. A few days earlier, the doctor at the hospital said that my mother s pneumonia was negative and she was taken out of isolation. Is it dangerous for my mother, who seems to be recovering or has recovered from her pneumonia, to be placed in the same room as a patient with advanced pneumonia?

    - Hi, I got diagnosed with Pneumonia yesterday and have been sent home with antibiotics (amoxicillin and doxycycline) I was just wondering what the risk factors would be if I were to have at least one [cigarette](symptom)?

    - My father 82 years old was in the hospital for pneumonia and per cardiac catherization showing blockage. It was diagnosed that blockage was too much for bypass or stent. Only medication is given to help heart. Heart muscles also showed dead so it was no use to have bypass surgery per cardiac physician as even if blockage removed muscles would not help heart. My question is that now released from home he has been very uncomfortable during night sleep. He moans while asleep. He gets up and sits on bed. He then lays back and the same continues. He states being tired from hospital stay. He states he is tired from stay in hospital like hospital bed etc.  He really gets to sleep at 6 am and then during the day he is fine. Then the next night it starts again. Has been home since Feb. 2. Current medical doctor provided meds to sleep but that was worse. My mother is the primary caretaker and has reported his night sleep is off after returning home. Does the new diagnosis cause this or is there is a reason. Thanks.

It s ranging usually from 96-97 but sometimes it ll get to like 98.0 and thats while I m sweating so bad that s my shirt will be soaked and hair wet like I was standing outside in the sun for an hr in middle of summer. It s sick. Should I be worried?
    - my son is 3 years old, and came down with a head cold wed, it moved immediately to his chest (he is a preemie-grad, and has had trouble with pneumonia and rsv in past) he is running a temp, and his respiratory rate is between 48-50.  I just don't know if i should wait it out a little longer to see what the day brings or take him in.

    - My fiancé has been coughing uncontrollably every night for the past 4 months. He is 23 years old, 5'9", about 140 lbs., and has been told by his dr that he has walking pneumonia. He has been prescribed antibiotics, cough syrup, allergy medicine, mucinex, nasal sprays, and inhalers and although they suppress the coughing at times he still does not seem to have gotten rid of the coughing. His coughing is accompanied with phlegm and has also caused him to throw up due to the extremity. He does smoke cigars as well. What is this!?
    - How can one be sure of a diagnosis of pneumonia or [pertusses](symptom) in adults. How do you compare? My doc thinks I have [pertusses](symptom). But the doctor in Mexico where I was originally treated said I had [PB pneumonia](symptom). I was on intravenous antibiotics for three days in Mexico before coming home to my dr.here in L.A.The xrays showed lots of mucus in my lungs.  I am confused.  is there a definitive test for petusses in adults? Dr said I will be fine. Gave me ADVAIR and cough medicine and says I will be fine but will cough for a pretty long while until the lungs are clear.  He said I do not need antibiotics because I have already had zpack and 10 days of ampicillin, and then 3 days fo intravenous antibiotics. Who do I believe? I am 65 years old. never was feeling this sick or tired before or have had any kind of lung involvement in my life.  I am a strong healthy woman. No immune deficiency or anything like that.
    - Went to the doctor 3 weeks ago for possible exercise induced asthma due to chest pain. They have me a daily steriod inhaler and albuterol rescue inhaler.

Just last night I went to urgent they said I still have the [pneumonia](symptom) got a steroid injection and a medrol dose pack. Still getting worse...not sure what to do and the chest pain seems worse, and the levaquin has made my stomach very irritated which is expected. The steroids make sleeping impossible and I constantly feel overheated since the injections and dose pack I started yesterday.
