    "text": "Hello doctor,Last night I was getting chills, feeling more cold than usual and lightheaded and a lot of burping. Maybe like every 30 minutes or less or so feel more chills running down my body and chest feeling bit weird like I am starting having trouble breathing then goes back to normal and repeats, with weird feeling like chills down my left and right lungs or left and right upper chest. Also, my heart was pumping fast. Also, some minor coughs were there since seven days ago, still here. I have white mucus and have not gotten yellow yet.I took medicines yesterday but today I got severe cold and flu medicine with a pain reliever, the chills did not go away. Then today, I called the doctor on the phone and told him what happen last night and the same thing happened this morning too. I had minor coughs, feeling lightheaded, feel like maybe cannot breathe or something, and a lot of burping. I told him the burping issue was going on for at least two years, but somehow this time I am feeling lightheaded. He just gives Pepcid, a try maybe GERD. I ate that today still feeling chills now and still burping a lot.Right now, still some chills on arms, with breathing issue or something makes my chest feel weird and arm sometimes. So, should I be worried? I do not think I have a fever now but do not feel hot on the forehead? Was it GERD or flu, it is Coronavirus or something else? I hope it is not Coronavirus.I am 21 years old and weigh around 110-115 kg.",

I have been off work for 3 weeks now and feel completely washed out and exhausted. I had a chest x-ray which was clear, but was given an inhaler temporarily as I was out of breath and wheezy. I still have an incredible amount of phlegm which has now changed from brown to sometimes green to clear. Unfortunately, for last 3 days, my trachea is extremely bruised to touch and feel as if someone is pressing my windpipe. Although my tonsils aren t swollen, my ear hurts deep inside. I have had to start taking paracetamol again this week as feel weak, wobbly and feel as if I am going backwards again instead of improving. I am 45 years old. Non-smoker.This is the 3rd time I have had pneumonia in 18 years. I am reasonably fit and healthy, and I don t suffer from colds normally, but whenever I come down with something, I seem to suffer with it. How long does it take to get back to normal? Are the trachea symptoms part of the initial pneumonia symptoms or would I need to see the GP again. I am feeling extremely fed up of generally feeling unwell. I am taking a tonic (Metatone) and drinking and eating healthily. Basically, is it normal to feel this unwell for so long.",

    "text": "I was recently diagnosed with Pneumonia. I had pneumonia when I was a baby but never since. I was shocked when I heard the diagnosis. The symptoms became apparent on March 28. I began taking Doxycycline Monohydrate on Monday April 3 and must take them for seven days. I am mega healthy and have not been sick in years. I can t even remember the last time I was sick. This has really knocked me out. I have zero energy and very little appetite. How does pneumonia manifest in the lung and how does bacteria get in there? How long will it be until I recover? I am really having a hard time with this. Help!",
